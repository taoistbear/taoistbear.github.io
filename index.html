        <p><img  id="josh" src="images/josh_sm.jpg" alt="Picture of Josh" />I know what you are thinking. <i>"This page is ugly... what is this guy doing putting something like this up for the whole world to see!"</i> Well, I am a Full Stack JavaScript Hobbyist. Design is not my forte. This is my main landing page for projects and progress as I continue to learn, adapt and practice my skills as a developer. I am building out my basic structure and presentation with pure HTML and CSS and reinforcing those essential design skills. As I learn more I will add more projects and pages to showcase those techniques integrating Bootstrap, Sass and other well known design time savers. This page will also exclusively use pure JavaScript. There are many great libraries to use that make scripting esier, more concise and much more efficient, yet as with the HTML and CSS I choose to fortify my understanding Web Application Design and Development from the bottom up.</p>
        <p>Please continue to check back on this page every month or so as it grows and builds along with my skills and comfort languages with the latest tricks. There will also be explainiations, desciptions, as well as tips and tricks I have picked up a long the way. Learning is a community process and I will always be willing to share what I know with others who wish to take the journey into the wonderful world of web and program develpment.</p>
        <p>Currently the nav links at the top are active and linked to pages that will slowly have content. I plan on using pure JavaScript with AJAX to create a <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr> experience with the exception to links from my projects tab that highlight newer techniques and integrate Node.js and Anglular projects incorpoating databases and full user interaction. Below are links to my Git Hub, LinkedIn and Twitter, feel free to follow and join me.</p>
