          <h2 class="title">An Introduction</h2>
          <p>It truly is a lot more difficult to write about oneself and put it out here online for all to read, copy, paste and share. This digital and social age we live in some find it easier to connect with the ambiguous and anonymous masses than to open up to a close friend. While that is somewhat true, being shielded from judgment and hurt via block buttons and the lack of physical interaction; creating a biography and summary of oneself, distilling what make and individual unique without falling into the traps and mores of subculture identification takes true thought and craft.</p>
          <p>I do not fall into the camp that believes life(s) equals more than the sum of experiences and interactions. Life itself is the sum of that that interaction and connection. Much is lost when attempting to tally and total, clarify and quantify what the great philosophers of ages past can describe yet not explain. This biography page is not me, it is not a curriculum vitae of sorts. It is the essence of who I am up this point.</p>
          <p>If you are reading this, you are either family or a friend, other programing hobbyist and/or potential employer. For any of the above or complete stranger I hope you enjoy my honest and simple writing. You will notice a sense of catharsis and self identifying satire not unlike one of my favorite authors, the late Kurt Vonnegut. Enjoy this rambling of my autobiography for what it is for I am writing this more for myself than you.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Life is a Journey</h2>
          <p>I know this topic is somewhat trite and clich&eacute;, yet my life truly has been a journey. I was raised in North West New Mexico and my travels have taken me to all over the United States from coast-to-coast, Hawaii, Mexico, and Canada. (Yes, I do believe in the Oxford Comma, if you have not noticed yet.) I fully expect to continue my exploration of the world and experience more cultures. To me food, culture, traditions are so uniquely wonderful and should be shared and enjoyed as well as appreciated and celebrated for their history.</p>
          <p>There are many types and forms of journeys one can take through one's own lifetime. Some journeys are personal, some are professional, and other's will defy category. I will briefly breakdown some of my journeys in this page to give an understanding not only of where I have been or where I more than likely will go, yet where my potential lies. This should truly be the root of who someone is. The journey and potential. A snapshot in time is only that. I brief yet fleeting moment that will never again occur in the natural order of the universe or multiverse. It is gone the moment it is defined. One needs to look sideways, through their periphery and see the shadows dancing on the wall (Plato).</p>
