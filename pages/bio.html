          <h2 class="title">An Introduction</h2>
          <p>It truly is a lot more difficult to write about oneself and put it out here online for all to read, copy, paste and share. This digital and social age we live in some find it easier to connect with the ambiguous and anonymous masses than to open up to a close friend. While that is somewhat true, being shielded from judgment and hurt via block buttons and the lack of physical interaction; creating a biography and summary of oneself, distilling what make and individual unique without falling into the traps and mores of subculture identification takes true thought and craft.</p>
          <p>I do not fall into the camp that believes life(s) equals more than the sum of experiences and interactions. Life itself is the sum of that that interaction and connection. Much is lost when attempting to tally and total, clarify and quantify what the great philosophers of ages past can describe yet not explain. This biography page is not me, it is not a curriculum vitae of sorts. It is the essence of who I am up this point.</p>
          <p>If you are reading this, you are either family or a friend, other programing hobbyist and/or potential employer. For any of the above or complete stranger I hope you enjoy my honest and simple writing. You will notice a sense of catharsis and self identifying satire not unlike one of my favorite authors, the late Kurt Vonnegut. Enjoy this rambling of my autobiography for what it is for I am writing this more for myself than you.</p>

          <h2 class="title">Life is a Journey</h2>
          <p>I know this topic is somewhat trite and clich&eacute;, yet my life truly has been a journey. I was raised in North West New Mexico and my travels have taken me to all over the United States from coast-to-coast, Hawaii, Mexico, and Canada. (Yes, I do believe in the Oxford Comma, if you have not noticed yet.) I fully expect to continue my exploration of the world and experience more cultures. To me food, culture, traditions are so uniquely wonderful and should be shared and enjoyed as well as appreciated and celebrated for their history.</p>
          <p>There are many types and forms of journeys one can take through one's own lifetime. Some journeys are personal, some are professional, and others will defy category. I will briefly breakdown some of my journeys in this page to give an understanding not only of where I have been or where I more than likely will go, yet where my potential lies. This should truly be the root of who someone is; journey and potential. A snapshot in time is only that. I brief yet fleeting moment that will never again occur in the natural order of the universe or multiverse. It is gone the moment it is defined. One needs to look sideways, through their periphery and see the shadows dancing on the wall (Plato).</p>
          <p>Some of the stories below may seem somewhat recursive and overlap, but do not fret. Like peeling and onion life has many layers. Some points and aspects intersect yet have dramatically different meanings depending on the reference and point of view. This is not just to clarify to you, the reader, of my intent and outline; it is an exercise for me, the author, in another form of journey.</p>

          <h2>Places</h2>
          <p>As stated previously I was born and raised in Northwestern New Mexico. This area of the country is beautiful and stunning. The sunsets in the South West are particular and unique. While I do not currently reside in New Mexico and do not necessarily plan on returning I am proud and satisfied with the experiences and perspective I gained growing up in a small corner of The Land of Enchantment.</p>
          <p>Looking back at my childhood  through high school and even into my early twenties, my siblings and I seemed wild and free. We roamed the high desert, saw rattlesnakes and mountain lions, jumped off sandstone cliffs into deep cool water, and stepped on cactus reminding us to be mindful of our surroundings. We were free to ride our bikes as far as we could go as long as we returned home before anyone worried. We could talk to strangers without fear of abuse. But what I remember most about growing up is the smell of grass. There is nothing like the smell of fresh cut grass on a summer's evening in New Mexico with the still cool air and the rose colored glow of the sunset.</p>
          <p>The summer before my senior year of high school I had the opportunity to live on a coffee farm in Kailua Kona, Hawaii. It truly was a slice of paradise. There was soft evening rain, the culture was slow and welcoming, and sights of farms on mountainsides drifting down to beaches of every color. Unspoiled beauty was everywhere. I did not realize the Earth could be so vivid and lush.</p>
          <p>After high school I moved to Southern New Mexico at a time where college students could still visit Juarez, Mexico to enjoy some underage drinking. Now the border cities of Mexico are more dangerous and not quite as free. I also spent some time in Los Angeles trying to find myself. I enjoyed the weather, the remarkable landscapes. This was the first time I spent a prolonged period of time with a population so dense. People where everywhere, as far as the eye could see and further.</p>
          <p>In such a short period of time I experienced so many cultures, the Navajo, the Hawaiian, Hispanic. I do consider myself blessed to have done and seen so much. It did not stop there. There was a period of time where I lived in rural West Virginia. Most recently I came to appreciate and enjoy the densely populated North East. Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey became a second home to me before spending a few years in Rhode Island. I have seen Atlanta, Savannah, Washington D.C., New York, Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Boston, Portland, San Diego and Baltimore. I was able to see the Winter Carnivals of Quebec and Ottawa and spend Canada Day in Nova Scotia.</p>
          <p>I have made many friends and met many more acquaintances. There are adventures all around and always new sites to see. Now I reside in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. I do find this somewhat ironic as my mother was born in Minneapolis and moved to New Mexico when she was a child.</p>
